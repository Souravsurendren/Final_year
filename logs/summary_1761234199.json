    "Patient Presentation & Chief Complaint:\nThe patient, Mr Tan Ah Kow, is a 55-year-old man who was brought to the clinic in a wheelchair. He has a history of medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple strokes. He was diagnosed with dementia and has been under follow-up treatment since November 2010. The patient is currently incontinent, unable to bathe or use the toilet on his own, but can feed himself. He has shown a gradual deterioration in cognitive ability and physical state over the years.\n\nClinical Findings & Examination Results:\nUpon examination, Mr Tan Ah Kow was found to have a euthymic mood and no psychotic symptoms. However, he demonstrated impaired orientation to time, place, and person. He was unable to tell that he was in a hospital clinic, but he could identify his son and tell his own name. He was unable to remember the correct date, day, or year. He could not tell the time from a watch and had difficulty with basic arithmetic. He was unable to recognize notes or coins and had trouble remembering basic information about his personal welfare and property.\n\nDiagnostic Tests & Imaging Findings:\nThe patient was diagnosed with dementia and has a history of multiple strokes, confirmed by CT and MRI brain scans. He also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart problems (cardiomyopathy), cardiac failure, and chronic renal disease.\n\nTreatment & Medications:\nThe report does not provide specific information on the patient's current medications or treatments. However, given his medical history, it is likely that he is receiving treatment for his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart conditions, and chronic renal disease. He may also be receiving medications to manage his dementia symptoms.\n\nFollow-up Recommendations & Prognosis:\nThe patient is not likely to regain mental capacity due to the progressive nature of his dementia. Regular assessments of his mental capacity should be carried out to monitor his condition. The patient is unlikely to understand if informed of this application due to his cognitive impairment.\n\nNotes:\nThe report does not provide specific information on the patient's current medications or treatments. The report also does not provide the results of the patient's CT and MRI brain scans. The patient's son, Mr Tan Ah Beng, provided some of the patient's medical history and personal information.",
