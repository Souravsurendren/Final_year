The patient is currently incontinent, unable to bathe or use the toilet on his own, but can feed himself. He has shown a gradual deterioration in cognitive ability and physical state over the years.\n\nClinical Findings & Examination Results:\nUpon examination, Mr Tan Ah Kow was found to have a euthymic mood and no psychotic symptoms. However, he demonstrated significant impairment in orientation to time, place, and person. He was unable to tell that he was in a hospital clinic, but he could identify his son and tell his own name. He was unable to remember the correct address of his residence and incorrectly stated the Prime Minister's name. He also showed difficulty with basic arithmetic, financial issues, and personal welfare/property and affairs-related questions.\n\nDiagnostic Tests & Imaging Findings:\nThe patient has a history of medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple strokes. He was diagnosed with dementia and has been under follow-up treatment since November 2010. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT and MRI brain scans during his hospitalization in April 2010.\n\nTreatment & Medications:\nThe report does not provide specific information on the treatment and medications administered to the patient. However, it mentions that the patient has been under follow-up treatment for dementia since November 2010.\n\nFollow-up Recommendations & Prognosis:\nThe patient is not likely to regain mental capacity, as his cognitive functions are unlikely to improve and may worsen over time due to his dementia. No specific follow-up recommendations or review schedule are provided in the report.\n\nNotes:\nThe report does not provide information on the patient's vital signs, physical findings, or physician observations. Additionally, there is no mention of any other doctor who holds a different professional opinion regarding the patient's mental capacity. The report also lacks specific information on the treatment and medications administered to the patient.",
