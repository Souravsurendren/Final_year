    "Patient Presentation & Chief Complaint:\nThe patient, Mr Tan Ah Kow, is a 55-year-old man who was brought to the clinic in a wheelchair. He has a history of medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple strokes since 1990. He was diagnosed with dementia and suffered a stroke in 2010. The patient is currently incontinent and unable to bathe or use the toilet on his own, but can feed himself. He has shown a gradual deterioration in cognitive ability and physical state over the years.\n\nClinical Findings & Examination Results:\nMr Tan's mood was euthymic, and he did not exhibit any psychotic symptoms during the examination. However, he showed impairments in orientation to time, place, and person. He was unable to tell that he was in a hospital clinic, but he could identify his son and tell his own name. He was unable to remember the correct date, day, or year, and he could not tell the time from a watch. He also had difficulty remembering basic information, such as his age and the address where he lives.\n\nDiagnostic Tests & Imaging Findings:\nThe patient's medical history includes CT and MRI brain scans confirming a stroke diagnosis in 2010. However, the report does not provide further details on the results of these scans or any other diagnostic tests.\n\nTreatment & Medications:\nThe report does not provide information on the treatments administered or drugs prescribed to the patient.\n\nFollow-up Recommendations & Prognosis:\nThe patient's prognosis is poor, as his cognitive functions are unlikely to improve, and his dementia is expected to worsen over time. The report does not provide specific follow-up recommendations or a review schedule.\n\nNotes:\nThe report does not provide information on the patient's vital signs, physical findings, or physician observations. Additionally, there is no information on the patient's laboratory or radiology reports. The report also does not mention any discharge advice or further tests that may be required.",
