The patient is currently incontinent, unable to bathe or use the toilet on his own, but can feed himself. He has shown a gradual deterioration in cognitive ability and physical state over the years.\n\nClinical Findings & Examination Results:\nUpon examination, Mr Tan Ah Kow was found to have a euthymic mood and no psychotic symptoms. However, he demonstrated impaired orientation to time, place, and person. He was unable to tell that he was in a hospital clinic, but he could identify his son and tell his own name.

He was unable to recognize notes or coins and had trouble remembering basic information about his personal welfare and property.\n\nDiagnostic Tests & Imaging Findings:\nThe patient was diagnosed with dementia and has a history of multiple strokes, confirmed by CT and MRI brain scans. He also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart problems (cardiomyopathy), cardiac failure, and chronic renal disease.\n\nTreatment & Medications:\nThe report does not provide specific information on the patient's current medications or treatments.
